To make things easier, CNN Business Reporter Anna Cooban explains with a very simple analogy.\n",

      "President Trump’s global tariffs - the most significant escalation America has imposed in a century — are having ripple effects across the global economy.

To make things easier, CNN Business Reporter Anna Cooban explains with a very simple analogy.\n",
